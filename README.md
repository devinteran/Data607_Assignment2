# Data607 - Assignment2
This assignment analyzes the movie popularity from survey data and rotten tomate website data.   The SQL script first loads survey data into tables.  The assumption is that a database, movies, exists already.  

The Rstudio script,Assignment2.Rmd, pulls in data from the movies database.  The SQL login information has been removed from this file for security purposes.  

This was created and run on a mac.
